SIGWfast is a python code to compute the Scalar-Induced Gravitational Wave spectrum from a primordial scalar power spectrum that can be given in analytical or numerical form. This extension performs the two-dimensional integrations needed in this computation using compiled C++ code. The code SIGWfast, including this extension, is distributed under the MIT license, a copy of which should be included with the code. If not, see https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html.
